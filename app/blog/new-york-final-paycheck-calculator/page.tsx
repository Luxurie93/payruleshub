const articleHtml = '<h1>New York Final Paycheck Calculator: Estimate Your Last Check</h1>\n<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2026</p>\n<p>New York final pay questions often come down to two separate issues: how much earned pay is still owed, and when the employer must pay it. This guide helps you estimate the wage components that may appear in a final check and understand the policy questions to review.</p>\n<p>This page is designed to be practical: use it as a worksheet, then open the related PayRulesHub calculator to estimate the math. Because payroll rules depend on facts, employer policy, and current law, always verify important decisions with an official agency or qualified professional.</p>\n<h2>What to review for New York</h2>\n<ul><li>Final wages are generally expected by the next regular payday after separation.</li><li>Earned wages, including covered overtime or commission amounts that are due and calculable, should be included.</li><li>Unused vacation or PTO payout usually depends on the employer policy, handbook, agreement, or established practice.</li></ul>\n<h2>How to estimate the amount</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Collect your latest pay stub, hourly rate or salary, pay period, and year-to-date deduction information.</li>\n<li>List unpaid regular hours, overtime hours, earned commissions or bonuses, and any unused PTO or vacation balance.</li>\n<li>Calculate gross pay first, then estimate federal, state, local, FICA, and benefit deductions where applicable.</li>\n<li>Compare your estimate to the employer pay stub and note any gap you need to ask about.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>New York example estimate</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Unpaid regular hours:</strong> 24 × $28 = $672</li><li><strong>Overtime estimate:</strong> 5 × $42 = $210</li><li><strong>Possible PTO if policy pays out:</strong> 16 × $28 = $448</li><li><strong>Estimated gross final pay before taxes:</strong> $1,330</li></ul>\n<p>These examples are simplified.
